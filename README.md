### What is Discord?
If you ask Wikipedia, “Discord is a proprietary freeware voice-over-Internet Protocol application designed for video gaming communities, that specializes in text, image, video and audio communication between users in a chat channel.”

In simple words, Discord is a communication app, much like Telegram or WhatsApp. It’s a place where communities can get together and interact with each other. The Discord app works with desktop and mobile platforms, combining the features of a chat lobby, a message board, and voice chats into one app.
