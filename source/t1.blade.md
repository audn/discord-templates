This is an example of how you can set up your Discord server.
If you click the edit button, you can edit the channels just to get that *extra feeling*, in case theres a few channels you didn't like.

**:white_check_mark: Done!**
Nice! Time to get it to your server! Luckily, we've made a bot to do that for you.
Invite our bot to your server, and type `.load <number>`

**:question: Support**
Join our official Discord server **here**.
